                        My name is Greta Schock and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer. My interest in SWE stems from the human element of web development. After receiving my both Bachelor of Arts in International Affairs - Latin America concentration and Anthropolgy, but I have since shifted to software engineering to create accessible tools that will have a positive impact on the global community. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect!

I'm currently working on passion projects while also considering other employment opportunities. My interest stems from the human element of web development. My professional background thus far has been in guiding and tourism, but I have since shifted to software engineering to create accessible tools that will have a positive impact on the global community. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect!
